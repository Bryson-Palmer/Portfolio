# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Bryson Palmer - Student Jr Web Developer
I am currently a bootcamp *full stack* web developer student through the *University of Washington* under *Trilogy Education Services*. I'm looking to get into web development for my professional work. I plan on being a capable, creative, team oriented developer by the end of this program. I look forward to implementing this new skill in future employment. 

Goal: </br>
To give a potential employer work samples from my deployed portfolio. I built a web portfolio page from scratch that I can add to as the course of this bootcamp progresses.
