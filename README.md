# Welcome to my Portfolio
## Bryson Palmer - Student Jr Web Developer
I am currently a bootcamp *full stack* web developer student through the *University of Washington* under *Trilogy Education Services*. I'm looking to get into web development for my professional work. I plan on being a capable, creative, team oriented developer by the end of this program. I look forward to implementing this new skill in future employment. 

Goal: </br>
To give a potential employer work samples from my deployed portfolio. I built a web portfolio page from scratch that I can add to as the course of this bootcamp progresses. 

## Acceptance Criteria üíº
* When the portfolio is loaded my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me are presented.
* When navigation links are clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When the work link is clicked, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications.
* When presented with my first applicatin, the image will be larger in size than the images of my other applications.
* When the images of the applications are clicked on, the user will be taken to that deployed application. 
* When the page is resized or viewed from various screens and devices, the layout is responsive that adapts to the viewport. 

- [‚úîÔ∏è] **Status Complete**

## In Addition üèÜ
* Added meta data to aid in *search engine optimization* by adding a description and keywords to the head of the code.
* Added meta data to set the *viewport* to make website look good on all devices.
* Included *comments* throughout the **HTML** and **CSS** code to label and/or explain about function.

- [‚úîÔ∏è] **Status Complete**
